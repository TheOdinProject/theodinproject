# Controls whether Active Job's `#perform_later` and similar methods automatically defer
# the job queuing to after the current Active Record transaction is committed.
#
# Example:
#   Topic.transaction do
#     topic = Topic.create(...)
#     NewTopicNotificationJob.perform_later(topic)
#   end
#
# In this example, if the configuration is set to `:never`, the job will
# be enqueued immediately, even though the `Topic` hasn't been committed yet.
# Because of this, if the job is picked up almost immediately, or if the
# transaction doesn't succeed for some reason, the job will fail to find this
# topic in the database.
#
# If `enqueue_after_transaction_commit` is set to `:default`, the queue adapter
# will define the behaviour.
#
# Note: Active Job backends can disable this feature. This is generally done by
# backends that use the same database as Active Record as a queue, hence they
# don't need this feature.

# Adds image/webp to the list of content types Active Storage considers as an image
# Prevents automatic conversion to a fallback PNG, and assumes clients support WebP, as they support gif, jpeg, and png.
# This is possible due to broad browser support for WebP, but older browsers and email clients may still not support
# WebP. Requires imagemagick/libvips built with WebP support.

###
# Enable validation of migration timestamps. When set, an ActiveRecord::InvalidMigrationTimestampError
# will be raised if the timestamp prefix for a migration is more than a day ahead of the timestamp
# associated with the current time. This is done to prevent forward-dating of migration files, which can
# impact migration generation and other migration commands.
#
# Applications with existing timestamped migrations that do not adhere to the
# expected format can disable validation by setting this config to `false`.

# Controls whether the PostgresqlAdapter should decode dates automatically with manual queries.

# Example:
#   ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::PostgreSQLAdapter.select_value("select '2024-01-01'::date") #=> Date
#
# This query used to return a `String`.
