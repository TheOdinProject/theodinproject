   <h2>Community Rules</h2>

    <p>
      Our Discord server is a very active community of people from all over the world and is moderated by a team of volunteers. Our moderation team has 3 different <a href="https://github.com/TheOdinProject/top-meta/blob/main/about/discord-roles.md" target="_blank">roles</a>: Core, Maintainer, and Moderator.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our moderation team is committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, neurodivergence, personal appearance, body, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.
    </p>

    <p>
      We expect everyone to handle themselves in a professional manner and follow the spirit of our community rules. The moderation team enforces our rules through a zap system using the Dyno bot. The zaps are private to the user and will be communicated through direct messages or private threads.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are given a warning by our moderation team, please consider our point of view and be willing to change without taking it personally or being argumentative. Our rules are very similar to the expectations in professional workplaces, so this will better prepare you to interact professionally with your future teammates.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our rules have different levels of severity and zaps are given at the discretion of the moderator team. Repeated offenses automatically increase to the next penalty tier. Zaps accumulate over time if rules continue to be broken to ensure the well-being of our entire community.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>10 total zaps will result in a ban.</strong>
    </p>

    <h3 id="zap-level-0">0 Zaps - "Heads Up" Warning for Very Minor Violations</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Asking about or encouraging the use of Windows</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Discussing unrelated topics that can be divisive or harmful</strong> such as politics, religion, relationships, mental health, medical concerns, homeopathic or medicinal remedies, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dog piling/short circuiting a teaching moment</strong> by jumping in to help when someone else is already helping out or giving an answer when someone is leading someone to think critically about their problem.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Chat bombing</strong> by posting many short (usually 4-5 or fewer words) messages in rapid succession or repeatedly sending parts of thoughts (incomplete, non-standalone sentences or fragments) in new messages. Instead, use shift + enter and send one message where possible or edit your message.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Inappropriate User Profile</strong> with suggestive or inappropriate memes as profile picture, username/nickname, or bio.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Crossposting or Duplicate Posts</strong> by posting the same message to different channels or asking for help in multiple channels at once. You should allow at least <strong>30 minutes</strong> for a reply. While you are waiting, make sure that you posted in the most relevant channel, provided a <a href="/how_to_ask" target="_blank">detailed question</a>, and continue trouble-shooting. It is recommended to edit your post with the results of things you have tried. If your post gets buried, you may repost your question, otherwise, you may direct people to your question in a more active channel.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="zap-level-1">1 Zap - Warning for Minor Violations</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>A second infraction of any 0 Zap issues above</strong>

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mini-modding or non-moderators enforcing rules</strong> by telling another user that they broke a rule. Our moderation team has been trained to handle rule breaking in a private and respectful manner. Although we know you mean well, public disagreements between users creates an unwelcoming community. Instead, <strong>send a DM to ModMail</strong> to report rule breaking or if you see something you're unsure about in the community
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="zap-level-2">2 Zaps - Warning for Medium Severity Violations</h3>

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Posting self promotions without permission</strong> by sharing resources you created solely for personal or monetary gain, for example: "Fill out my survey" (does not help the goals of Odin), "Join my boot camp/program/server" (could mislead learners), "Why PHP is superior" (unrelated blog post), job recruitment.

    <h3 id="zap-level-10">10 Zaps - Immediate Ban for Extreme Severity Violations</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Piracy</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Doxxing</strong>

        <strong>Spamming posts</strong> such as Discord Nitro spam, repeated random nonsensical messages (copypasta), or self promotion (joining just to promote material, no prior chat history).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Any other behavior deemed unacceptable and deserving of a ban by the moderation team</strong> such as not correcting <a href="https://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/" target="_blank">“help vampire”</a> behaviors.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="decay-example">Decay Explanation</h3>

    <p>
      Zaps decay at a rate of 1 zap per week. E.g., if you receive 5 zaps on a Friday, the following Friday you will have 4, the Friday after that you will have 3, and so forth. This means higher level infractions remain on record for a longer period of time and jeopardizes your participation in the server if rules continue to be broken.
    </p>

    <h3 id="zap-example">Example of Increasing Zaps for Repeated Offenses</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Dawson asked a question and is actively being helped by Tommy. Kierra knows the answer, so she posts the answer.</li>
      <li>Since Tommy was already helping Dawson, Kierra's post in considered dogpiling. Therefore, Kierra is warned about dogpiling and will receive zero zaps</li>
      <li>The next day, Kierra is warned about dogpiling again. Since this is her second offence, she will receive one zap because it increases to the next tier.</li>
      <li>Later that day, Kierra is once again warned about dogpiling. This time she will receive two zaps, therefore she now has a total of 3 zaps.</li>
      <li>The following day, Kierra is warned about dogpiling and received 5 zaps. She now has a total of 8 zaps.</li>
      <li>If Kierra dogpiles again within the next 8 weeks, she will receive 10 zaps and will be banned from the server.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="mini-mod-example">Example of Mini-Modding</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Darius posts a question about needing help on a freelance project.</li>
      <li>Jacob replies to Darius saying, “We do not support personal projects, see the rules”</li>
      <li>Darius is now upset because of the terseness of Jacob's reply and the two are now arguing.</li>
      <li>Jacob should have instead reported this to @ModMail so a member of the moderation team could privately address this issue with Darius.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Instructing another user in an authoritative manner leads to public disagreements which creates an unwelcoming environment. Instead, Jacob should have reported this to @ModMail so a member of the moderation team could notify Darius of the rules in private.
    </p>

    <h3 id="report-team">Our Core, Maintainer and Moderation team are also subject to the rules</h3>

    <p>
      If you see any of our team members have inappropriate behavior, please report it to @ModMail with a link to the post and brief explanation the rule that has has been broken. <em>Please do not argue publicly, instead communicate privately through @ModMail.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Please note that the entire TOP team has visibility on ModMail. If it makes you more comfortable, you may DM one member of the team with your concerns, or email the team at theodinproject@gmail.com.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>

    <p>
      This is not a comprehensive list of all possible scenarios and zaps are made at the discretion of the moderation team if particular behaviors are inappropriate but not otherwise explicitly covered. Please DM @ModMail if you would like to discuss these rules or any moderation activity (whether you are on the receiving end or not).
